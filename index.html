            <h2>MY JOURNEY</h2>
            <p>Before I enter to college, I have no idea what course that I've entered, because it's just my mother who recommend me to take BSIT. Afterwards, I decided to take that course but that time I honestly wanted to take a <span class="textDesign2">Medical Course</span> because I wanted to become a doctor but my family don't have that much of money to afford my desired course. As I take every semester of my Course, I never thought that I could be an excellent student in my College. My name got listed <span class="textDesign2">4 times in DL</span> and hoping to have a <span class="textDesign2">Latin Award</span> in the day of my graduation</p>
            <p>After many semesters that I've been through, I was chosen by my college to develop an scholarly application and this time it is in progress because we have many trainings and I have class during my summer season and my mentor is the <span class="textDesign2">Head of ICT</span> of my University. Most of the present and incoming lessons are <span class="textDesign2"> SEO / HTML5 / Internet Safety / Node JS / Angular JS / OO-PHP</span></p>
